              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
                
              <p>
                Emotional Intelligence is about the ability to manage your emotions, and understand what they mean or how they are affecting you or others. People with EQ also have high levels of empathy and can understand the emotional state of others. People with high EQ tend to be natural leaders and are often calm and in control of situations; they are not quick to judge or get angry with people. 
              </p>


              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">How is it different to IQ?</h4>
                
              <p>
                Your IQ determines your ability to learn or comprehend information. It's about how you think and how successful you are at completing complex mental challenges and connecting patterns through analysis. EQ is more about your ability to perceive emotion, control emotional meaning and evaluate yourself clearly.
              </p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">Why is it important?</h4>
                
              <p>
                It’s super important to know yourself and how you project on to others. I think a huge part of our working and social lives revolves around a certain level of empathy. Without empathy we aren't able to relate to each other, we might not hear someone or realise how we might be affecting people around us. You can be the smartest person in the room but without being able to read a room, speak to a group, comfort someone, or recognise discomfort, then all that cleverness only goes so far.
