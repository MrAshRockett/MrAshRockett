              <h4>In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</h4>
                
              <p>The command line is a text based version of the inner workings of the computer. It's sort of like how cars look nice on the outside, but strip that away and they are just engines and wheels and so on. Computers are similar in that the command line is what is used under the hood taking away the interface. </p>
                
                
              <h4>Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</h4> 
                  
              <p>Not so well, I found it a bit difficult to get into a rhythm. I have been sick with covid-19 this week, which has made it very difficult to focus. I have made some changes to my time planning such as chunking out sections fo the day, muting my phone and building a bookmark list of resources to help me solve things quicker.</p>
