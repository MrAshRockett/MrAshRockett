              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
                
              <p>
                I would like to spend some time as a developer when I finish Dev Academy and I would be interested in a role that was involved in solving design problems, to also utilise my design skills. It would be cool to be part of a creative studio or an area using new and emerging technologies. Long-term, my goal would be to lead a team and using my people skills.
              </p>
              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
                
              <p>
                My idea of my strengths and limitations hasn’t really changed during Foundations and I still identity with those that I wrote about during Sprint 2. One of the limitations I identified was struggling to stay focused for long periods of time. I think that will be mitigated by being at Bootcamp, because I work well and focus better when I’m around other people.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also identified that one of my strengths is learning quickly when things are practical, and I think this will also be a strength for Bootcamp, because it will be in person and more ‘hands on’ than the Foundation course.
              </p>
              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
                
              <p>
                My main non-technical challenge will be maintaining focus throughout the Bootcamp. I anticipate that the high workload will be tiring, and when I’m tired I am more easily distracted. 
              </p>
              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
                
              <p>
                I’d like to develop my skills working in a team. I enjoy working in a team already but I’d like to develop this skill further as it appears crucial to being successful in industry. Building my professionalism and learning more about how to get the best out of working with others will be important. 
              </p>
              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
              </h4>
                
              <p>
                To be helpful, friendly, supportive and patient, and to take the time to understand students’ learning needs.
              </p>
              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
              </h4>
                
              <p>
                I expect myself to keep in mind the importance of my decision to quit my job to study, and to use this as a driving factor to stay motivated when things are difficult. I will also try to be kind to myself when I’m struggling and to be patient with myself, while continuing to maintain a growth mindset.
                <br>
                <br>
                I will seek help from other students that appear to be ahead of me, and if they aren’t able to help I will ask the available facilitators for guidance. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I will manage my workload by making a to do list at the start of each day, keeping track of different deadlines so I can prioritise work accordingly, and talking to other students about the work.
                <br>
                <br>
                I will work productively and safely with others by listening to others, doing my best to help others if they are struggling - which will also help my own understanding - and being aware of when others are stressed or need extra support.

              <p>Original Learning Plan – Week 2 Foundations</p>
              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
                
              <p>My long term goal is to move into a role that not only builds my technical skillset, but also enables me to work with people in a mentorship capacity. I think eventually I’d love to lead a team in the web dev space, but that’s a fair way down the track. </p>


              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
                
              <p>Learning has always been something I’ve enjoyed, however when I need to focus on things for long periods of time my mind tends to wander. This also happens if i’m not 100% invested in what I’m doing. So I try very hard to keep myself engaged by tweaking the tasks to be better suited to my interests. However, I think I excel at learning quickly when it comes to practical activities and I think that coding definitely falls within that range.</p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
                
              <p>I would like to develop my self-awareness throughout this course. I find that sometimes I can act without thinking about how it might make others feel, usually just in a reactive way.</p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: <br>
                An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. <br>
                What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</h4>
                
              <p>I will work hard, focus as best I can and take regular breaks every 30-45 minutes. If I am struggling to manage or learn something new, I shall make smaller manageable chunked goals and work towards each of those with a break between each one. If things start to build up, I will check in with others and see how they are handling things. I find that reaching out to support someone else can help me to break away from my own loop and see the solution to the larger issue.</p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
                
              <p>I will seek help when I have exhausted all other avenues of support and spent sufficient time problem solving, before it becomes a poor use of my time to continue working alone.</p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
                
              <p>I expect fair and equal treatment abd support when I really need it, as some concepts I just may not be able to understand by myself. I also expect them to recognise and acknowledge when I’m doing something correctly or well, as I find affirmation a huge driver.</p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in</h4>
                
              <p>Nope, none currently. Unless something unexpected/unforseen occurs, I can: git commit -m “Added 100% of my time to Dev Academy”.</p>
