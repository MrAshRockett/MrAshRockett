              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
                
              <p>My long term goal is to move into a role that not only builds my technical skillset, but also enables me to work with people in a mentorship capacity. I think eventually I’d love to lead a team in the web dev space, but that’s a fair way down the track. </p>


              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
                
              <p>Learning has always been something I’ve enjoyed, however when I need to focus on things for long periods of time my mind tends to wander. This also happens if i’m not 100% invested in what I’m doing. So I try very hard to keep myself engaged by tweaking the tasks to be better suited to my interests. However, I think I excel at learning quickly when it comes to practical activities and I think that coding definitely falls within that range.</p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
                
              <p>I would like to develop my self-awareness throughout this course. I find that sometimes I can act without thinking about how it might make others feel, usually just in a reactive way.</p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: <br>
                An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. <br>
                What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</h4>
                
              <p>I will work hard, focus as best I can and take regular breaks every 30-45 minutes. If I am struggling to manage or learn something new, I shall make smaller manageable chunked goals and work towards each of those with a break between each one. If things start to build up, I will check in with others and see how they are handling things. I find that reaching out to support someone else can help me to break away from my own loop and see the solution to the larger issue.</p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
                
              <p>I will seek help when I have exhausted all other avenues of support and spent sufficient time problem solving, before it becomes a poor use of my time to continue working alone.</p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
                
              <p>I expect fair and equal treatment abd support when I really need it, as some concepts I just may not be able to understand by myself. I also expect them to recognise and acknowledge when I’m doing something correctly or well, as I find affirmation a huge driver.</p>

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in</h4>
                
              <p>Nope, none currently. Unless something unexpected/unforseen occurs, I can: git commit -m “Added 100% of my time to Dev Academy”.</p>
