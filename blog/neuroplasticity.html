                While researching, I found the mother of all links for researching neuroplasticity AND growth mindset. Fill with articles, advice, videos and more I learned a lot. After having a good amount of experience teaching, I realised while reading that I was already familiar with a few of the principles behind neuroplasticity. I have had my fair few experiences with encouraging students to realise they can learn anything if they focus on the process and reflect on their growth.

                <br>
                As for me, I think I was reminded of how some of the techniques had worked for some of my students, such as taking breaks, physical exercise, and a good night's sleep. So I began paying more attention to those things too. I found that I am way too fidgety for meditation to have any natural effect on me. But exercise and breaks do wonders for me, especially exercise. This enables me to really switch off at the end of the day for a good night's sleep and, it allows me time to think without any other stimulus such as a screen.

              <h4 class="title-bodycopy">Growth Mindset</h4>
                
              <p>
                A growth mindset is essential for believing you can learn something new. This is especially important when it comes to something as complex as JavaScript as the learning curve is quite high and the timeframe is not long at all. What was surprising was how much of a fixed mindset I still have from my upbringing. However, I will not let my old behavior get in the way of who I have become as an adult.

                <br>
                I know that my growth mindset will get me through this course and it will make me successful at everything I try to achieve. In the end, it comes down to regonising my own down talk taking a break and putting it aside, and focusing on what I HAVE achieved in order to lend perspective. Another thing I’ve read about online during my research has been this concept of having ‘Grit’. <i>“Grit refers to a student’s ability to persist after setbacks. Grit is related to mindset in that if one believes that failures are due to their fixed traits, there is no reason to try again. Conversely, individuals with growth mindset are more likely to be resilient and have more grit.”</i> I believe I have cultured grit since my mid to late teens and as an adult, I have been shown my potential by my loving and supportive partner. <a href="https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2018/4/19-1#:~:text=Grit%20refers%20to%20a%20student's,resilient%20and%20have%20more%20grit ">Link here.</a>

                I feel I have already touched on a few points already and my learning plan already discusses several points for a growth mindset so I’ll just say the following few things I’ve discovered this week. The first is specific learning methods for coding, in particular, Katas. I think these are fantastic and really helped me strengthen my understanding. The second would be the Rubber Duck method for problem-solving. I honestly never knew it was called that until I did the reading, but I have definitely done it in the past without realising that's what it was called. I’ll definitely be doing that except the rubber duck will be my poor girlfriend…
